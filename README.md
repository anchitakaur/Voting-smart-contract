1. Define Contract Variables
Owner: The contract creator (or "owner") is the only one with special permissions, like pausing and resuming the contract. When the contract is deployed, the creator’s address is stored as the owner.
Paused Status: A paused status keeps track of whether the contract is active or temporarily disabled. If paused is true, voting and other actions will be halted.
2. Candidate Structure
The contract uses a structure (called struct in Solidity) to store data for each candidate. Each candidate has a vote count, which keeps track of the total Ether they’ve received as votes.
3. Mapping for Candidates
We use a mapping (similar to a dictionary or hashmap in other programming languages) to link each candidate’s name to their vote count. This mapping allows the contract to keep track of all candidates by their names and look up their vote counts efficiently.
4. Event Logging
The contract includes an event to log each vote. This records the candidate’s name, the address of the voter, and the amount of Ether sent. Events are useful for tracking actions on the blockchain.
5. Contract Constructor
When the contract is deployed, a special function called the constructor runs once. This function sets the contract's owner to the address that deployed the contract and initializes the paused status to false (i.e., the contract is active by default).
6. Function Access Control
Only Owner Access: The contract includes a special check to make sure that only the owner can call certain functions, like pausing, resuming, and adding candidates.
Pause Check: The contract also has a check that restricts certain functions (like voting) when the contract is paused.
7. Adding Candidates
The contract owner can add new candidates to the contract. Each new candidate starts with zero votes and can be voted for by users.
8. Voting Mechanism
Users can vote for a candidate by sending Ether with their vote. Each Ether amount received is added to the candidate's total votes.
If a user sends no Ether, their vote is invalid, and the transaction will be rejected.
Every successful vote triggers an event, recording the candidate’s name, the voter’s address, and the amount sent.
9. Emergency Pause Mechanism
Pause Function: In case of an emergency or issue, the owner can pause the contract. When the contract is paused, voting and certain other functions are disabled. This provides a layer of security.
Unpause Function: The owner can later resume the contract by setting paused to false, allowing users to continue voting.
10. Checking Vote Count
Anyone can check the current vote count for any candidate by calling a function that returns the total Ether (or "votes") received for that candidate.

Features
Basic Voting: Users vote for a candidate by sending Ether.
Emergency Pause: The owner can pause and resume all functions in case of issues.
Vote Tracking: Keeps track of the total votes (Ether) each candidate receives.

How to Use This Contract
Deploy the Contract: The owner deploys the contract on the Ethereum network.
Add Candidates: The owner can add candidates by name.
Vote: Users vote for a candidate by sending Ether.
Pause or Resume: The owner can pause/resume the contract as needed.
Check Votes: Anyone can check a candidate’s vote count at any time.
